## Welcome to my Github!

I'm Nicky Kriplani (he/him), a software engineer at Atlassian. I recently graduated from NYU Tandon, where I majored in computer science, and am primarily interested in deep learning and randomized algorithms (especially for big data processing). I also do research with the NYU DICE Lab in representation learning and diffusion models.
